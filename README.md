### This will help in connecting people with common interests.

#### This project built using nodejs , reactjs , socket.io and monogodb

* Whenever people start learning new technology they need people who is quite expert in that domain and who can guide them .
* It's very difficult to get such one to one guidnace .
* To overcome this I have tried to apply traditional barter system in this process , that is give some other skill you have by taking a skill you need .
* To apply the above idea I have created a website which can match people with interests in common .
* for example a person who knows ML and want to learn android development is matched with a person who knows android development and want to learn ML .
* Chat option is also provided for ease of communication ( this is in development stage ).

### backend part

* built restapi using nodejs and mongodb as database .
* used jwt (json web token) for authentication process and also used bcrypt to encrypt the passwords of users.
* used mongoose for interaction with database .
* Implemented all the CRUD methods for users and gave permissions to user add his own skills .
* used socket.io for developing one to one chat option .

### frontend part

* used reactjs for the frontend.
* used axios to get data from restapi.
* used bootstrap4 for designing the website.
