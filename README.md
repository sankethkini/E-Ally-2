### This will help in connecting people with common interests.

#### This project built using nodejs , reactjs , socket.io and monogodb

* Whenever people start learning new technology they need people who is quite expert in that domain and who can guide them .
* It's very difficult to get such one to one guidnace .
* To overcome this I have tried to apply traditional barter system in this peocess , that give some other skill you have by taking a skill you need .
* To apply the above idea I have created a website which can match people with interests in common .
* for example a person who knows ML and want to learn android development is matched with a person who knows android development and want to learn ML .
* Chat option is also provided for ease of communication ( this is in development stage ).
